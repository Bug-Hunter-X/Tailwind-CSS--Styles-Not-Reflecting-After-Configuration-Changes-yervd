```javascript
// In your Tailwind CSS configuration file (tailwind.config.js)
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

```html
<!-- In your HTML file -->
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
  This should be red
</div>
```

**Error:** The div element doesn't render with the red background.

**Reason:** This often happens if you have made changes to your Tailwind CSS configuration but haven't run the `npm run build` or equivalent command to recompile the CSS.  Tailwind generates the final CSS based on your configuration and your HTML's classes; if this isn't executed, your custom classes won't be included.
